What if a kid's notebook looks more like scribbles than words, wouldn't it make you go - <i>ughhhhhh!</i> Here's a website that helps you read messy handwritings with ease by converting it to text. Also, Do teachers have to keep dealing with this always? No, because we're helping students to improve their handwriting by providing a space where they can practice it.
